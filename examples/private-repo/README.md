Private Repo Example
========================

A pipeline example where we have a private git repo in our package dependencies.


Development Machine Requirements
--------------------------------

In order for the build to run correctly, a few tools will need to be installed on your
development machine:

* Docker
* Docker-compose


Getting Started
---------------

Choose your example...: 

Run the following to generate the necessary keys:
```
mkdir -p keys/web keys/worker

ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ./keys/web/tsa_host_key -N ''
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ./keys/web/session_signing_key -N ''

ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ./keys/worker/worker_key -N ''

cp ./keys/worker/worker_key.pub ./keys/web/authorized_worker_keys
cp ./keys/web/tsa_host_key.pub ./keys/worker
```

Running The Build
-----------------

```
docker-compose up
```

Next, browse to your configured external URL (probably 127.0.0.1:8080 or 192.168.99.100:8080) and log in with the username **concourse** and password **changeme**.

[More info here...](https://concourse.ci/single-page.html#docker-repository)

Now we need to update our pipeline variable file with our Sinopia ip using this script:

```
./update
```

and update upgrade or set our pipeline...

Upgrade or set pipeline
-----------------------

For override our pipelines and pipelines config, we have to run:

```
fly -t localhost login -k -c http://localhost:8080
```

The login command will give you a link to click, and after you've gone through the OAuth flow it will print an OAuth token on the page that you can then then copy and paste into the prompt.

In either case, a token is saved in your ~/.flyrc, which will expire after one day. For then the rest of this day we can use this command:

Example with private-registry-pipeline:

```
fly -t localhost set-pipeline -c example-pipeline.yml -p pipeline -l pipeline-variables.yml -n
    
fly -t localhost unpause-pipeline -p pipeline
```

If you want destroy it:

```
fly -t localhost destroy-pipeline -p pipeline
```
